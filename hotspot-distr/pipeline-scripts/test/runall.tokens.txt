## Tags file in bam format (file extension .bam), or starched bed file
## (file extension .bed.starch).  If the tags file is in bed.starch
## format, and if it is in directory specified by _OUTDIR_, then it
## needs to be in the format
##
##     chr  5'start  5'start+1
##
## That is, the file should be three column bed (no ID field, etc.)
## containing the 1bp coordinates of the 5' ends of the tags. If
## _TAGS_ is a bam file, or a bed.starch file not in _OUTDIR_, then
## the bed.starch file in the above format will be generated (using
## the strand column if present), and put in _OUTDIR_.  NOTE: if you
## use run_badspot, then you must use bam files, or a bed.starch file
## not in _OUTDIR_.

_TAGS_ = /full/path/to/hotspot-distr/pipeline-scripts/test/test_DNase_seq.hg19.bam

## For ChIP data with an Input bam file, set _USE_INPUT_ to T, and set
## _INPUT_TAGS_ to the name of that bam file.

## Set DUPOK to T for DNaseI data, F for ChIP-seq data (DUPOK = T means allow duplicate reads)

## FDR levels, separated by spaces if more than one. Set to N if you
## do not want FDR thresholding (for example, if you just want SPOT
## score computed.)  
## _FDRS_ = "N"

## Tag density, 150bp window, sliding every 20bp, used for
## peak-finding.  Will be generated, based on the _TAGS_ file, if it
## does not exist. Assumed to be starched bed file, extension
## bed.starch.  Can be blank, in which case the density file will be
## generated in _OUTDIR_, and the the name will be the name of the
## tags file, minus the bam or bed.starch extension, with the added
## extension tagdensity.bed.starch.  
_DENS_:

## Output directories (can all be the same location).  Use full path names.
## _OUTDIR_ contains tags files in converted bed.starch and lib.txt formats (for hotspot
## program), and hotspot and peak results.
## _RANDIR_ contains generated random tags (for FDR thresholding) and hotspots called on random tags.

## omitted, include those here (only if you use run_badspot). May be
## left blank.
